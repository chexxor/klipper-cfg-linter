# Klipper Config Linter

A Python-based linting tool for analyzing and validating Klipper 3D printer configuration files. This tool helps identify common configuration issues, syntax errors, and potential problems in your Klipper config files before deploying them to your printer.

> **⚠️ WARNING: Project Under Heavy Development**
>
> This project is currently in early development stages and is not ready for production use. You may encounter bugs, incomplete features, and breaking changes.
>
> **Note:** Currently, there are very few implemented linting rules, so the tool will not be helpful for validating printer configurations yet. Please check back later as we continue to develop and implement more rules.
