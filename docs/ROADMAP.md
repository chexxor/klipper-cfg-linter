- [x] Implement basic config file parsing
- [x] Create foundational linting infrastructure
- [x] Develop initial set of basic validation rules
- [x] Set up automated testing framework
- [x] Release MVP version for early testing

### Phase 2: Data Collection and Analysis
- [x] Set up data mining infrastructure for Klipper issues
- [ ] Implement collectors for various data sources:
  - [x] GitHub issues
  - [x] Discourse forums
  - [ ] Discord server/channels
  - [ ] Documentation

- [ ] Implement feedback mechanism for false positives
- [ ] Create documentation for rule creation

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement auto-fix suggestions for common issues
- [ ] Add configuration templates and validation
- [ ] Develop integration with popular 3D printing tools
- [ ] Create plugin system for custom rules
- [ ] Implement machine-specific rule sets

### Community Involvement Opportunities
- **Issue Reporting**: Help identify common configuration problems that should be caught by the linter
- **Rule Development**: Contribute new rules or improve existing ones
- **Testing**: Test the linter with various printer configurations
- **Documentation**: Help improve rule documentation and usage guides
- **Feature Requests**: Suggest new features and improvements

### Timeline
- Phases 1-3 targeted for completion within the next 2 months
- Subsequent phases will be scheduled based on community feedback and project progress
